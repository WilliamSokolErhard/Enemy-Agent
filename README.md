# Enemy-Agent

This repo contains a project with a simply dynamic enemy AI that follows a predefined set of waypoints and uses a character controller with a collider and animations to navigate while avoiding obsticles. When the player is in the sight of an agent, it runs towards the player then trys to throw acid balls at them.
